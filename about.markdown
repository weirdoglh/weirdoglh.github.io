### "性灵" (xìng líng)

The term "性灵" (xìng líng) in Chinese culture, particularly in the realms of literature and philosophy, holds profound significance. It is often used to describe an individual's inner spirit and personality. In the theories of ancient Chinese literature and art, "性灵" is considered the essence of artistic creation.

-性 (Xing): Here, "性" refers to a person's nature or innate character. It represents the intrinsic qualities and tendencies that one is born with.

-灵 (Ling): "灵" pertains to the spirit or soul, and is more closely associated with aspects of spirituality, intelligence, and creativity.

In classical Chinese culture, "性灵" is frequently linked with artistic and literary talent. It is believed that a person's art or literary works should reflect their inner "性灵". This perspective emphasizes the importance of personal emotions and individuality in the creative process.

Overall, "性灵" is a profound concept that reflects the traditional Chinese cultural emphasis on the inner spirit and personal characteristics of individuals.

To grow and maintain it, feelings, thoughts, implementations, no matter how weird, should be recorded and, in time, well formulated. Therefore, I set up this blog to explore such a weirdo space. It will be filled with words about strange ideas, movie commentaries, beautiful translations, dreams, and whatever it is forming the more unconsious mental world. Alongside are more formulated ideas and expressions which are better articulated in different forms with thinking. In the end, some fruits born out of it with a compelete implementation over the ideas and feelings.
