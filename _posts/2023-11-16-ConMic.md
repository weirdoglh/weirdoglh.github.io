With the help of Fangshu, I got my first contact microphone. I heard this from one of DUKU's recordings where Xingyu shared six voices that really touched me. I recommend his project [鲸鱼马戏团 Whalecircus](https://music.douban.com/musician/133135/). He mentioned one of the works [离海最远的地方](https://music.douban.com/subject/35214233/?dt_dapp=1) in the recording.

I also have a habit of recording voices with VoiceMemo on iphone but never thought about sound underwater, minicule or inside object. Therefore, I bought one contact microphone and Fangshu helped me tested today. It will bring so much fun in the winter! Looking forward to it ~
